Requirements:
Develop a RESTful API using Express.js for an e-library to manage books, authors, users, borrowing, and returning transactions.
A borrowing transaction marks a book as checked out, while a return transaction marks it as available again.
Use a hardcoded array to store data in memory (no database management system is required).
Implement the four main CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with the appropriate HTTP verbs for managing the data.
Structure your routes using Express.Router to enhance readability and follow best coding practices.
Create a middleware that verifies if the Authorization header is set to "Bearer ZEWAIL" and rejects any requests that do not meet this requirement.
